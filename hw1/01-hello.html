          My name is Jessie Le, and I am an undergraduate student at Portland
          State University. This is my first time experiencing HTML, so I am
          excited to learn about it and hope to become familiar with it by the
          end of the term. In my free time, I am often spending quality moments
          with my friends and family, as it brings me joy and fulfillment.
